# Chat Application with WebSocket.io, React, and Vite

This chat application is built using WebSocket.io, React, and Vite for a seamless and real-time communication experience.

## Project Initialization

Follow these steps to initialize the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NikKms/websockets
   ```

   In the terminal, run either of the following commands based on your package manager (make sure to use the exact spelling "install"):

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

Choose one of the following options:

a) Open two terminals:

In the first terminal, navigate to the server directory:

```
cd server
```

Start the server:

```
yarn start
```

In the second terminal, navigate to the client directory:

```
cd client
```

Start the client development server:

```
yarn run dev
```

This way, you can view logs in the terminals.

b) Run both server and client without additional terminals:

Simply start the server and enjoy chatting without opening extra terminals:

```
yarn start
```

The application will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

As you are currently the only user in the chat, copy the address and paste it into another browser to start communicating and enjoying the chat experience.

Feel free to contribute and enhance the functionality of the chat application!
